/**
 * Defines a one-shot Mount. Every input is a named field: `args` declares the
 * args Schema, `messages` lists the Messages this Mount can produce, and
 * `execute` holds the work. `execute` receives the live `Element` as `element`
 * alongside the declared args, and returns an `Effect<Message>` that runs once
 * when the element mounts and produces exactly one Message.
 *
 * `args` is optional. Omit it and the Definition is callable as `Definition()`;
 * declare it and the Definition is callable as `Definition(args)`. `execute`
 * keeps the same shape either way, because a Mount always has an element. An
 * args field named `element` is rejected where you declare it, since it would
 * collide with the element `execute` receives.
 *
 * Constructing a MountAction never runs `execute`. The runtime calls it when
 * the element enters the DOM, so nothing the body does happens inside the pure
 * view that built the action.
 *
 * Cleanup composes via `Effect.acquireRelease` inside the Effect: registered
 * finalizers run when the element unmounts. The Mount's scope stays open
 * across the element's full lifetime, even after the Effect completes.
 *
 * At least one result Message schema is required. The Effect's success
 * type is `Schema.Schema.Type<Messages[number]>`; without a declared
 * result, `execute` would have to return `Effect.never`, leaving
 * `update` with no record of the work and removing DevTools, Scene,
 * and time-travel replay's reference point. Fire-and-forget Mounts
 * follow the same convention as fire-and-forget Commands: declare a
 * `Completed*` result Message that `update` no-ops on. The side
 * effect stays observable; `update` simply has nothing meaningful to
 * do with the acknowledgment.
 *
 * Cleanup is asynchronous with respect to snabbdom's `destroy` hook: the
 * runtime forks `Fiber.interrupt` and returns immediately, so finalizers run
 * on a separate fiber after `destroy` has already completed. For idempotent
 * DOM operations (`element.remove()`, observer `disconnect()`,
 * `removeEventListener`) this is fine; if your cleanup has ordering
 * requirements relative to other DOM removals, prefer doing the imperative
 * work synchronously inside `acquire` and using `release` only for
 * self-contained teardown.
 *
 * **Construct resources INSIDE the acquire body, never before it.**
 * `Effect.acquireRelease` only guarantees atomicity of "acquire body
 * completes → release is registered". If you construct a handle before
 * calling `acquireRelease` and your acquire body just returns that handle
 * (`Effect.sync(() => alreadyExistingValue)`), interruption between the
 * construction and the registration leaks the handle. For third-party
 * library instantiation, express the construction as the success value of
 * the acquire Effect: `Effect.tryPromise(() => import(...)).pipe(Effect.map(...))`
 * for async imports, `Effect.sync(() => new Thing(...))` for sync
 * construction. The discipline: whatever the release function needs as
 * input must be the success value of the acquire Effect.
 *
 * Use this form whenever a Mount produces a single Message at acquire and
 * holds lifecycle-scoped resources for the element's lifetime. For Mounts
 * that emit a continuum of events (scroll listeners, IntersectionObservers,
 * MutationObservers), reach for `Mount.defineStream`.
 *
 * @example One-shot, no cleanup (read element geometry on mount)
 * ```ts
 * const MeasurePanelWidth = Mount.define('MeasurePanelWidth', {
 *   messages: [MeasuredPanelWidth],
 *   execute: ({ element }) =>
 *     Effect.sync(() =>
 *       MeasuredPanelWidth({ width: element.getBoundingClientRect().width }),
 *     ),
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @example One-shot with cleanup (portal-to-body)
 * ```ts
 * const PortalToBody = Mount.define('PortalToBody', {
 *   messages: [CompletedPortalToBody],
 *   execute: ({ element }) =>
 *     Effect.gen(function* () {
 *       yield* Effect.acquireRelease(
 *         Effect.sync(() => document.body.appendChild(element)),
 *         () => Effect.sync(() => element.remove()),
 *       )
 *       return CompletedPortalToBody()
 *     }),
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @example With args
 * ```ts
 * const AnchorPopover = Mount.define('AnchorPopover', {
 *   args: { buttonId: Schema.String, anchor: AnchorConfig },
 *   messages: [CompletedAnchorPopover],
 *   execute: ({ element, buttonId, anchor }) =>
 *     Effect.gen(function* () {
 *       yield* Effect.acquireRelease(
 *         Effect.sync(() => anchorSetup(element, { buttonId, anchor })),
 *         cleanup => Effect.sync(cleanup),
 *       )
 *       return CompletedAnchorPopover()
 *     }),
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * **Args are captured at mount, not refreshed across renders.** `execute`
 * runs once when the element enters the DOM. Subsequent renders construct
 * fresh `MountAction` values with updated arg values, but those values are
 * captured in closures that never execute. `OnMount` only binds to
 * snabbdom's `insert` and `destroy` hooks; there is no `update` hook in
 * between. Name args to reflect this. Prefer `initialScroll` over
 * `currentScroll` for values whose role is to seed state at mount time.
 *
 * If you need Model changes to drive ongoing DOM behavior post-mount, the
 * proximate cause is the Message that updated the Model. Dispatch a Command
 * from `update`'s handler for that Message. The Command can find the
 * element and do the imperative work. Don't reach for a Subscription here.
 * Subscriptions watch Model state via `modelToDependencies` to gate their
 * lifetime, but their emissions come from external event sources (timers,
 * document events, library callbacks), not from Model state itself.
 * Translating Model changes into side effects is what `update` does on
 * every Message, via the Commands it returns. (Subscriptions do legitimately
 * touch the DOM in some contexts: calling `preventDefault` in an event
 * handler where going through `update` would arrive too late, or
 * maintaining DOM state for as long as a Model condition is true (like
 * applying `user-select: none` to the document while a drag is in progress
 * and undoing it when the drag ends).)
